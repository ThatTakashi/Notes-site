## Website Designs:
This first design takes inspiration from animated shows and illustrations. The design is based around a large image in the middle of the screen that takes up most of the page. With the studio logo and site navigation on the side this creates quite a simple yet visually pleasant design that feels quite calm and cozy.

The second design is a very informative design that is able to display a lot of information at once while remaining modern looking. This design allows many projects to be shown off at once. The design was based off of the Japanese bento box style of containers.
