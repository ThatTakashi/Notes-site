Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems? Checkout our [FAQ and Troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting.md).\n\n## Language Support\n[CJK + Latex Support (ÊµãËØï)](CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(ÊµãËØï).md) comes out of the box with Quartz.\n\nWant to support languages that read from right-to-left (like Arabic)? Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```toml\ndefaultContentLanguage = 'ar'\n[languages]\n  [languages.ar]\n    languagedirection = 'rtl'\n    title = 'ŸÖÿØŸàŸÜÿ™Ÿä'\n    weight = 1\n```\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-22T02:12:21.817411388Z","tags":["setup"]},"/Setup/custom-Domain":{"title":"Custom Domain","content":"\n### Registrar\nThis step is only applicable if you are using a **custom domain**!

You should set the environment variable `HUGO_BASEURL=http://your-public-ip` and then start your container.\n2. Set up port forwarding on your router from port `p` to `your-local-ip:1313`.\n3. You should now be able to access Quartz from outside your local network at `http://your-public-ip:p`.\n\nHowever, your HTTP connection will be unencrypted and **this method is not secure**.\n\n### To a Domain using Cloudflare Proxy\n\n1. Port forward 443 (HTTPS) from your machine.\n2. Buy a custom domain (say, `your-domain.com`) from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/). Point a DNS A record from `your-domain.com` to your public IP address and enable the proxy.\n3. Set the environment variables `HUGO_BASEURL=https://your-domain.com`, `HUGO_PORT=443`, and `HUGO_APPENDPORT=false`. Change `1313:1313` to `443:443` for the `ports` in `docker-compose.yml`.\n4. Spin up your Quartz container and enjoy it at `https://your-domain.com`!\n\n### To a Domain using a Reverse Proxy\n\nIf you want to serve more than just Quartz to the internet on this machine (or don't want to use the Cloudflare registrar and proxy), you should follow the steps in the section above (as appropriate) and also set up a reverse proxy, like [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik).

You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.**\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files.

Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site.

Quartz does all of that for you and gives your own little corner of the internet.\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-22T02:12:21.821411426Z","tags":[]},"/Setup/preview-changes":{"title":"Preview Changes","content":"\nIf you'd like to preview what your Quartz site looks like before deploying it to the internet, the following\ninstructions guide you through installing the proper dependencies to run it locally.\n\n\n## Install `hugo-obsidian`\nThis step will generate the list of backlinks for Hugo to parse. Ensure you have [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (\u003e= 1.16) installed.\n\n```bash\n# Install and link `hugo-obsidian` locally\ngo install github.com/jackyzha0/hugo-obsidian@latest\n```\n\nIf you are running into an error saying that `command not found: hugo-obsidian`, make sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly (see [[troubleshooting#`command not found: hugo-obsidian`|the troubleshooting page]])! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize hugo-obsidian as an executable.\n\n##  Installing Hugo\nHugo is the static site generator that powers Quartz. [Install Hugo with \"extended\" Sass/SCSS version](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) first. Then,\n\n```bash\n# Navigate to your local Quartz folder\ncd \u003clocation-of-your-local-quartz\u003e\n\n# Start local server\nmake serve\n\n# View your site in a browser at http://localhost:1313/\n```\n\n\u003e [!INFO] Docker Support\n\u003e\n\u003e If you have the Docker CLI installed already, you can avoid installing `hugo-obsidian` and `hugo`. Instead, open your terminal, navigate to your folder with Quartz and run `make docker`\n\nAfterwards, start the Hugo server as shown above and your local backlinks and interactive graph should be populated! Now, let's get it hosted online.\n\n\u003e üåç Step 5: [Hosting Quartz online!](hosting.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-22T02:12:21.821411426Z","tags":["setup"]},"/Setup/search":{"title":"Search","content":"\nQuartz supports two modes of searching through content.\n\n## Full-text\nFull-text search is the default in Quartz. It produces results that *exactly* match the search query. This is easier to setup but usually produces lower quality matches.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: false\n```\n\n## Natural Language\nNatural language search is powered by [Operand](https://beta.operand.ai/). It understands language like a person does and finds results that best match user intent. In this sense, it is closer to how Google Search works.\n\nNatural language search tends to produce higher quality results than full-text search.\n\nHere's how to set it up.\n\n1. Login or Register for a new Operand account. Click the verification link sent to your email, and you'll be redirected to the dashboard. (Note) You do not need to enter a credit card to create an account, or get started with the Operand API. The first $10 of usage each month is free. To learn more, see pricing. If you go over your free quota, we'll (politely) reach out and ask you to configure billing.\n2. Create your first index. On the dashboard, under \"Indexes\", enter the name and description of your index, and click \"Create Index\". Note down the ID of the index (obtained by clicking on the index name in the list of indexes), as you'll need it in the next step. IDs are unique to each index, and look something like `uqv1duxxbdxu`.\n3. Click into the index you've created. Under \"Index Something\", select \"SITEMAP\" from the dropdown and click \"Add Source\".\n4. For the \"Sitemap.xml URL\", put your deployed site's base URL followed by `sitemap.xml`. For example, for `quartz.jzhao.xyz`, put `https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/sitemap.xml`. Leave the URL Regex empty. \n5. Get your API key. On the dashboard, under \"API Keys\", you can manage your API keys. If you don't already have an API key, click \"Create API Key\". You'll need this for the next step.\n6. Open `data/config.yaml`. Set `enableSemanticSearch` to `true`, `operandApiKey` to your copied key, and `operandIndexId` to the ID of the index we created from earlier..\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nsearch:\n  enableSemanticSearch: true\n  operandApiKey: \"jp9k5hudse2a828z98kxd6z3payi8u90rnjf\"\n  operandIndexId: \"s0kf3bd6tldw\"\n```\n7. Push your changes to the site and wait for it to deploy.\n8. Check the Operand dashboard and wait for your site to index.

If you are unfamiliar, [this resource](https://resources.nwplus.io/2-beginner/how-to-git-github.html) is a great place to start!\n\n### Forking\n\u003e A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.\n\nNavigate to the GitHub repository for the Quartz project:\n\nüìÅ [Quartz Repository](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)\n\nThen, Fork the repository into your own GitHub account. **Make sure that when you fork, you _uncheck_ the 'Copy the `hugo` branch only' option**.\n\nIf you don't have an account, you can make on for free [here](https://github.com/join). More details about forking a repo can be found on [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).\n\n![[fork.png]]\n\n### Cloning\nAfter you've made a fork of the repository, you need to download the files locally onto your machine. Ensure you have `git`, then type the following command in your terminal replacing `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username.\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/quartz\n```\n\n## Editing\nGreat!

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (ÊµãËØï)](CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(ÊµãËØï).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac)\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile # again, (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac)\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup analytics?\nQuartz by default uses [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) for analytics. \n\nIf you would prefer to use Google Analytics, you can follow this [guide in the Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/templates/internal/#google-analytics). \n\nAlternatively, you can also import your Google Analytics data into Plausible by [following this guide](https://plausible.io/docs/google-analytics-import).\n\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\nüêõ [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-22T02:12:21.821411426Z","tags":[]},"/Setup/updating":{"title":"Updating","content":"\nHaven't updated Quartz in a while and want all the cool new optimizations?

What is causing slow downs with my dads work and what could a digital outcome do to help change this?\n\n## Analysis\nFrom my research, I can tell that there is quite the variation in the offerings from each different company. Each have their own pros and cons. Here I want to go through and analyze each piece of software and pick out different things that would make my digital outcome better for my stakeholder.\n\n### Base Requirements:\nIn terms of my digital outcome I have a few base requirements that will need to be met in order for my outcome to be successful. They are:\n\n**Simplicity**\n- The app must be as simple to operate as my stakeholder is not very good with technology\n\n**Speed**\n- My app should be fast. My stakeholder ends up with a lot of active jobs at once. The app should be able to handle all of these while remaining fast.\n- The app should have a very fast way of adding jobs to the list. I want as little friction as possible with adding tasks to the app.\n\n**Usability**\n- I want my app to feel as familiar as possible for the end user. I know that my stakeholder uses an android phone and thus my design mockup has been designed by using components from the [Material design 3](https://m3.material.io/) library. These components are likely familiar to android users.\n\nThese requirements are essential to creating an app that my stakeholder will actually want to use. Following these are also needed to make my app easy to use and instantly understandable.","lastmodified":"2023-07-22T02:12:21.825411464Z","tags":["School","Digital-Technologies"]},"/notes/Inquiry-Standard-Research":{"title":"Inquiry Standard Research","content":"# Existing Products - General Time Management\n\n## Asana:\n\n### What is it?:\nAsana is a general purpose project\\time management software suite that allows teams to better organize their time.\n\n### Pros:\n- Has a clean and easy to use interface\n- Many options for viewing current and future tasks\n    - Kan-ban style boards\n    - Timeline based view\n    - Calendar View\n    - List view\n- Provides app integration and automation features\n    - Allows the linking of existing workshop systems\n    - Allows repetitive tasks such as adding a customer to be automated\n\n### Cons:\n- Provides a great free plan however it gets quite expensive quite quickly, once the limits of the free plan are reached\n- Some of the more advanced features can be a bit difficult to get setup\n\n---\n\n## Monday.com:\n\n### What is it?:\nMonday.com is a business focused project/team management tool that is perfect for large businesses that want to better manage their time.\n\n### Pros:\n- Has plenty of tutorials to help new users get started with the software\n- Has a full suite of tools not only for project management but for business management in general\n    - Kan-ban boards\n    - Standard table views\n    - Timeline views\n    - Chart views\n    - Dashboards\n        - Allow the organization of multiple sets of data\n        - Let's the admin of a workspace display all of the tasks and data that is relevant to each user on one page as soon as they login\n\n### Cons:\n- Again, monday.com has a great free plan but it gets very expensive per month once you hit the limits of the free plan\n    - Paid plans get more expensive per month the more people you have needing to use the software\n    - The free plan only allows for two people to access the software under one account\n\n---\n\n# Existing Products - Focused Time Management\n\n## Mechanicdesk:\n\n### What is it?:\nMechanicdesk is a suite of software for mechanics.

When new music is loaded the volume is reset.\n\n---\n\n### pygame.mixer.music.get_volume()\n\nget the music volume\nget_volume() -\u003e value\n\nReturns the current volume for the mixer. The value will be between 0.0 and 1.0.\n\n---\n\n### pygame.mixer.music.get_busy()\n\ncheck if the music stream is playing\nget_busy() -\u003e bool\n\nReturns True when the music stream is actively playing. When the music is idle this returns False.\n\n---\n\n### pygame.mixer.music.set_pos()\n\nset position to play from\nset_pos(pos) -\u003e None\n\nThis sets the position in the music file where playback will start. The meaning of ‚Äúpos‚Äù, a float (or a number that can be converted to a float), depends on the music format. Newer versions of SDL_mixer have better positioning support than earlier. An SDLError is raised if a particular format does not support positioning.\n\n---\n\n### pygame.mixer.music.get_pos()\n\nget the music play time\nget_pos() -\u003e time\n\nThis gets the number of milliseconds that the music has been playing for. The returned time only represents how long the music has been playing; it does not take into account any starting position offsets.\n\n---\n\n### pygame.mixer.music.queue()\n\nqueue a music file to follow the current\nqueue(filename) -\u003e None\n\nThis will load a music file and queue it. A queued music file will begin as soon as the current music naturally ends. If the current music is ever stopped or changed, the queued song will be lost.\n\nThe following example will play music by Bach six times, then play music by Mozart once:\n\n```python\npygame.mixer.music.load('bach.ogg')\npygame.mixer.music.play(5)        # Plays six times, not five!\npygame.mixer.music.queue('mozart.ogg')\n```\n\n---\n\n### pygame.mixer.music.set_endevent()\n\nhave the music send an event when playback stops\nset_endevent() -\u003e None\nset_endevent(type) -\u003e None\n\nThis causes Pygame to signal (by means of the event queue) when the music is done playing. The argument determines the type of event that will be queued.\n\nThe event will be queued every time the music finishes, not just the first time. To stop the event from being queued, call this method with no argument.\n\n---\n\n### pygame.mixer.music.get_endevent()\n\nget the event a channel sends when playback stops\nget_endevent() -\u003e type\n\nReturns the event type to be sent every time the music finishes playback. If there is no endevent the function returns¬†pygame.NOEVENT.","lastmodified":"2023-07-22T02:12:21.825411464Z","tags":["Project","Programming","School"]},"/notes/Python-Music-Player":{"title":"Python Music Player","content":"\n## Brief:\n\nCreate a simple python music player that can control music and have music added to it via importing files.
