### Explanation:
I found this design to be the most indicative of the UX methods that I chose to research about and base my design exploration on. The design is both modern and clean looking with a small splash of colour on the edges but its also very easy to read and understand due to the high contrast borders and typography. I believe that I have been able to incorporate this accessibility feature quite nicely into my design.

### Final Thoughts:
I feel that my design is fit for purpose because it takes into account the two UX methods that I initially researched as well as providing a striking design that will leave a lasting impact of visitors of the site.

My design also addresses several implications such as:
- **Aesthetics:**
	- My design is striking and of a style that could border on brutalist design, this design style makes heavy use of borders and high contrast elements.
	- The one big thing that my design does differently from brutalist design is its use of calm colours. Brutalist design is often known for its use of saturated and quite "in your face" colours.
	- My design is also instantly understandable and was designed in such a way that there is no point in time where the user is stuck or lost for what to click on to get somewhere.
- **Accessibility:**
	- My design caters for people from all different runs of life, I have brought in elements such as large text and high contrast elements to make my site as easy to understand as possible.
	- I also have left little hints for the user as to how to interact with the site. For example, the home page has a pointer in the bottom corner with a label that reads "Scroll Down". This caters for users that perhaps are not so versed with technology or the internet.

In the end, I used multiple UX methods to influence my design. These include, Visual Design, Accessibility and Interaction Design. Each of these methods influenced a large part of my design from the small interactions in the form of quiet hints to the very back bones of the visual design itself. I found that these UX methods out of the whole lot, had the most impact on my design for the reasons stated above.

Despite how much care I have put into this design, I am well aware that during the development portion of this project, certain parts of my design are subject to change. These changes would be for the benefit of the design and would be as a result of certain oversights that may have occurred in the design portion of this project.
