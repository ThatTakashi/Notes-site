## Site Topic:
A portfolio website for myself

## Purpose of my website:
This website will be used to show off my skills as a creative person and all of the projects that I have done. 
To be successful my website will need to have:
- A clean and simple UI
- It has to be as fast as possible
- It must be able to be used on multiple different sized devices

## User Experience Methodologies:
### Visual Design:
Visual design primarily consists of 5 key principles, these are:
- **Scale**
	- Refers to both the scale of a single object as well as the scale of the object in relation to other objects
	- Scale can also affect the perceived Visual Hierarchy
- **Visual Hierarchy**
	- **Visual hierarchy** controls the delivery of the experience. If you have a hard time figuring out where to look on a page, it’s more than likely that its layout is missing a clear **visual hierarchy**.
	- **Visual Hierarchy** can be made by simply changing the size or colour of text to convey a difference in the importance of each piece of text.
- **Balance**
	- The principle of **balance** refers to a satisfying arrangement or proportion of design elements. **Balance** occurs when there is an equally distributed (but not necessarily symmetrical) amount of visual signal on both sides of an imaginary axis going through the middle of the screen. This axis is often vertical but can also be horizontal.
	- **Balance** can be:
		- *Symmetrical:*
			- Elements are symmetrically distributed relative to the central imaginary axis
		- *Asymmetrical:*
			- Elements are asymmetrically distributed relative to the central axis
		- *Radial:*
			- Elements radiate out from a central, common point in a circular direction
- **Contrast**
	- The principle of **contrast** refers to the juxtaposition of visually dissimilar elements in order to convey the fact that these elements are different (e.g., belong in different categories, have different functions, behave differently)
	- The principle of **contrast** is applied through colour a lot of the time. For example, red is often used in UI design to signify deleting something or to highlight something of importance.
- **Gestalt Principles**
	- **Gestalt principles** explain how humans simplify and organise complex images that consist of many elements, by subconsciously arranging the parts into an organised system that creates a whole, rather than interpreting them as a series of disparate elements. Gestalt principles capture our tendency to perceive the whole as opposed to the individual elements.

### Accessibility:
A good design/outcome is one that can be used by any and all. This is why sites like *google* and *youtube* are so simple in their design, they are designed in such a way that it will allow as many different users from as many different backgrounds as possible to use the website. My design should be no different because allowing as many people to access and navigate my site as possible will ensure that I can gain as much exposure as possible.
