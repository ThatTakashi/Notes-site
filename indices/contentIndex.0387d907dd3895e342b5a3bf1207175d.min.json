39 Topics/36 Fiction/36.01 Cyberpunk|Cyberpunk]] styled game and it takes place many years in the future. So that means lots of neon and technology. I want to create a game where each level has its own feel and atmosphere.\n\nMy game also will take heavy inspiration from [[notes/30 - 39 Topics/30 World/30.01 Japan|Japan]] design and culture. Japanese design is often mixed in with the cyberpunk design style. I also want to bring some Japanese design elements into the designs for my game studio.","lastmodified":"2023-08-08T02:33:20.276846869Z","tags":["Project","School","DES"]},"/notes/20-29-Project-Management/20-Current-Projects/20.02-Design-Project/Logos":{"title":"Logos - Design Project","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-08-08T02:33:20.276846869Z","tags":["Project","School","DES"]},"/notes/20-29-Project-Management/20-Current-Projects/20.02-Design-Project/Website":{"title":"Website - Design Project","content":"\n## Website Designs:\nThis first design takes inspiration from animated shows and illustrations.

Each have their own pros and cons as well as their own focus in terms of target end users. Here I want to go through and analyze each piece of software and pick out different things that I would use/adapt to make my digital outcome better for my stakeholder.\n\n### Base Requirements:\nIn terms of my digital outcome I have a few base requirements that will need to be met in order for my outcome to be successful. They are:\n\n**Simplicity**\n- The app must be as simple to operate as my stakeholder is not very good with technology\n\n**Speed**\n- My app should be fast. My stakeholder ends up with a lot of active jobs at once. The app should be able to handle all of these while remaining fast.\n- The app should have a very fast way of adding jobs to the list. I want as little friction as possible with adding tasks to the app.\n\n**Usability**\n- I want my app to feel as familiar as possible for the end user. I know that my stakeholder uses an android phone and thus my design mockup has been designed by using components from the [Material design 3](https://m3.material.io/) library. These components are likely familiar to android users.\n\nThese requirements are essential to creating an app that my stakeholder will actually want to use. Following these are also needed to make my app easy to use and instantly understandable.\n\n![[notes/Images/app.png|400]]\n### What makes a good productivity application?:\nAll good productivity tools should allow us to do one thing, manage time. All other things are addons, here is a list of the extras I found that people expect from a productivity app:\n- **Task** based tools\n- **Calendar** functions/integration\n\t- Able to integrate with the likes of *google calendar*\n\t- Add, Change and Remove events\n- Integrations with other services such as\n\t- **Todo** apps like *Todoist*\n\t- **Note** apps like *Notion, Obsidian, Etc*.\n\t- **Email** clients like *Outlook* or *Gmail*\n- Ability to **link** notes and times/dates to tasks\n- The ability to add **collaborators** to a workspace\n\t- Allow **multiple people** to access and change the same data\n\t\t- Would be useful in a setting with multiple mechanics needing to access the same job list\n\t- Enable different users to have different **permissions**\n\n### What I found from my research?:\nEach app that I researched has its own pros and cons as well as a \"**thing**\" that it is best at. I conducted this research so that I could find any apps that matched my base requirements as well as I wanted to look for anything that these apps do that I could take inspiration of to improve my own app.\n\nFor each app that I conducted research on, I made an effort to be as nit picky as possible. I tested two apps that are meant for general task management and I tested two apps that are made specifically for mechanics. I want to see if the apps that are built for mechanics match my base requirements better than the general purpose apps.\n\n#### General Purpose apps:\nThe two apps that I tested in this category are **Monday.com** and **Asana**. Each of these apps have vast feature sets that can cater to many different workflows. This makes each one very easy to use for businesses in many different fields. Despite their large feature set, this can also be their downfall. The large feature set can be overwhelming for new users and navigating through each feature can be painful. Each feature takes time to learn to use and most mechanics are not technically inclined and thus this will be overwhelming for them. Many workers want something that just works out of the box and that requires very little tweaking to work correctly in their workflow.\n\n#### Mechanic Focused apps:\nThese apps are tailor made for mechanics and thus include a very focused feature set out of the box. They are designed in such a way that they are as easy to integrate into the workflow of a mechanic as possible. This is achieved through simple interface design and streamlined features. They cut out all of the unnecessary features in an effort to make their software as easy to use as possible. Most mechanics in my experience have only a single computer to work off of so many of the collaboration features are not super useful.\n\n## Conclusions:\n### What this means for my outcome?:\nBy researching what apps are already out there as well as what end users that are using those kinds of programs want out of a productivity tool, I have worked out quite a lot about the kinds of design conventions go into a tool like this. People like to have a fair amount of features in an application like this and they want an application like this to be able to connect to other applications in their workflow like a POI (point of sale) system for example. Knowing this will allow me to fully design my digital outcome in such a way that it will meet the end-users expectations. \n\n### But how does this help my dad at work?:\nMy dad is a very visual person and likes to get things done in a quick manner. My digital outcome will provide a fast and easy way to both list and complete tasks. I would also like to connect my app to the shops point of sale system. This would elevate yet another point of friction when integrating the app into the dads workflow as it would allow jobs to be added to the app automatically. The shop also has a system that sends the customer a text message when their bike has been repaired, I feel that this could be something that could be integrated into the feature set of my app. It would send a text to the customer when my dad checks the job off as done.","lastmodified":"2023-08-08T02:33:20.276846869Z","tags":["Project","School","DGT"]},"/notes/20-29-Project-Management/20-Current-Projects/20.04-Inquiry-Standard/Inquiry-Standard-Research":{"title":"Inquiry Standard Research","content":"## Existing Products - General Time Management\n\n## Asana:\n\n![[notes/Images/asana.png]]\n### What is it?:\nAsana is a general purpose project\\time management software suite that allows teams to better organize their time.\n\n### Pros:\n- Has a clean and easy to use interface\n- Many options for viewing current and future tasks\n    - Kan-ban style boards\n    - Timeline based view\n    - Calendar View\n    - List view\n- Provides app integration and automation features\n    - Allows the linking of existing workshop systems\n    - Allows repetitive tasks such as adding a customer to be automated\n\n### Cons:\n- Provides a great free plan however it gets quite expensive quite quickly, once the limits of the free plan are reached\n- Some of the more advanced features can be a bit difficult to get setup\n\n---\n\n## Monday.com:\n\n![[notes/Images/monday.png]]\n### What is it?:\nMonday.com is a business focused project/team management tool that is perfect for large businesses that want to better manage their time.\n\n### Pros:\n- Has plenty of tutorials to help new users get started with the software\n- Has a full suite of tools not only for project management but for business management in general\n    - Kan-ban boards\n    - Standard table views\n    - Timeline views\n    - Chart views\n    - Dashboards\n        - Allow the organization of multiple sets of data\n        - Let's the admin of a workspace display all of the tasks and data that is relevant to each user on one page as soon as they login\n\n### Cons:\n- Again, monday.com has a great free plan but it gets very expensive per month once you hit the limits of the free plan\n    - Paid plans get more expensive per month the more people you have needing to use the software\n    - The free plan only allows for two people to access the software under one account\n\n---\n\n# Existing Products - Focused Time Management\n\n## Mechanicdesk:\n\n![[notes/Images/mechanicdesk.png]]\n### What is it?:\nMechanicdesk is a suite of software for mechanics.

The value will be between 0.0 and 1.0.\n\n---\n\n### pygame.mixer.music.get_busy()\n\ncheck if the music stream is playing\nget_busy() -\u003e bool\n\nReturns True when the music stream is actively playing. When the music is idle this returns False.\n\n---\n\n### pygame.mixer.music.set_pos()\n\nset position to play from\nset_pos(pos) -\u003e None\n\nThis sets the position in the music file where playback will start. The meaning of “pos”, a float (or a number that can be converted to a float), depends on the music format. Newer versions of SDL_mixer have better positioning support than earlier. An SDLError is raised if a particular format does not support positioning.\n\n---\n\n### pygame.mixer.music.get_pos()\n\nget the music play time\nget_pos() -\u003e time\n\nThis gets the number of milliseconds that the music has been playing for. The returned time only represents how long the music has been playing; it does not take into account any starting position offsets.\n\n---\n\n### pygame.mixer.music.queue()\n\nqueue a music file to follow the current\nqueue(filename) -\u003e None\n\nThis will load a music file and queue it. A queued music file will begin as soon as the current music naturally ends. If the current music is ever stopped or changed, the queued song will be lost.\n\nThe following example will play music by Bach six times, then play music by Mozart once:\n\n```python\npygame.mixer.music.load('bach.ogg')\npygame.mixer.music.play(5)        # Plays six times, not five!\npygame.mixer.music.queue('mozart.ogg')\n```\n\n---\n\n### pygame.mixer.music.set_endevent()\n\nhave the music send an event when playback stops\nset_endevent() -\u003e None\nset_endevent(type) -\u003e None\n\nThis causes Pygame to signal (by means of the event queue) when the music is done playing. The argument determines the type of event that will be queued.\n\nThe event will be queued every time the music finishes, not just the first time. To stop the event from being queued, call this method with no argument.\n\n---\n\n### pygame.mixer.music.get_endevent()\n\nget the event a channel sends when playback stops\nget_endevent() -\u003e type\n\nReturns the event type to be sent every time the music finishes playback. If there is no endevent the function returns pygame.NOEVENT.","lastmodified":"2023-08-08T02:33:20.280847105Z","tags":["Project","School","PRG"]},"/notes/20-29-Project-Management/21-Past-Projects/21.01-Python-Music-Player/Python-Music-Player":{"title":"Python Music Player","content":"\n## Brief:\n\nCreate a simple python music player that can control music and have music added to it via importing files.
