## Exhibition Research 1:

This exhibition shows the distinct design of an arched roof. I love the negative  space that is present both below and around the design. It allows the space to be traversed and lets the viewers get a more up close and personal view of the whole design. The design of this exhibition is also super simple however I feel that adds a spotlight towards the main piece rather than distracting from it. The slopped design of the room also guides the viewer down, through the design and towards the back of the room where it looks like more information is available on the design itself. The colours in the room also lend themselves nicely to drawing the viewers attention to the the main piece in the room.

This other shot of the same exhibition shows how the main piece can almost fold around the viewers. This is not only an amazing feat of engineering but is also would provide an amazing visual experience for any viewers in the room. The way it bends around the pathway allows it to form an almost tunnel like structure that completely changes its feel compared to its open form.

This exhibition of vertical urbanism showcases some of the extraordinary work by Zaha Hadid. It is an interactive piece that invites the viewer to fully immerse themselves in the artwork. The main piece in the middle of the room stands tall as the largest point of interest in the room. This grabs the viewers attention thus drawing them into the room for a closer look. Its then that the viewer will notice all of the extra decorations around the room that tightly complement the main middle piece.

This other view of the same room from the same exhibition further shows the elegance of all of the pieces in this room. The hanging pieces in the room are designed in such a way that they visually feel almost light, like clouds. And the centrepiece feels both modern and natural at the same time thanks to the curls and folds in the design.
