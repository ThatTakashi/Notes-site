## Site Topic:
A portfolio website for myself

## Purpose of my website:
This website will be used to show off my skills as a creative person and all of the projects that I have done. 
To be successful my website will need to have:
- A clean and simple UI
- It has to be as fast as possible
- It must be able to be used on multiple different sized devices

## User Experience Methodologies:
### Visual Design:
Visual design primarily consists of 5 key principles, these are:
- **Scale**
	- Refers to both the scale of a single object as well as the scale of the object in relation to other objects
	- Scale can also affect the perceived Visual Hierarchy
- **Visual Hierarchy**
	- Visual hierarchy controls the delivery of the experience. If you have a hard time figuring out where to look on a page, itâ€™s more than likely that its layout is missing a clear visual hierarchy.
	- Visual Hierarchy can be made by simply changing the size or colour of text to convey a difference in the importance of each piece of text.
- **Balance**
	- 
- **Contrast**
- **Gestalt Principles**
